# React Native New Architecture Disabled

## Summary
The React Native new architecture has been disabled to resolve CMake build errors. This change allows the project to build using only Java modules without requiring CMake or C++ compilation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `/android/gradle.properties`

The following changes were made to disable the new architecture:

- **Changed `newArchEnabled` from `true` to `false`** (line 35)
  - This is the main flag that controls whether the new architecture is enabled

- **Added additional properties to ensure complete disabling:**
  ```properties
  # Disable Fabric (new architecture renderer)
  react.fabric.enabled=false
  
  # Disable TurboModules
  react.turbomodules.enabled=false
  
  # Skip CMake-based build steps
  android.native.buildOutput=false
  ```

## What This Means

1. **No CMake Required**: The build process will no longer attempt to compile C++ code using CMake
2. **Classic Architecture**: The app will use React Native's classic architecture (Bridge-based communication)
3. **Java Modules Only**: Custom native modules (GitModule, TerminalModule) will work as pure Java implementations
4. **Simpler Build Process**: The build process is now simpler and doesn't require native compilation tools

## Build Compatibility

These changes ensure that:
- The app can be built without CMake installed
- Pure Java native modules work correctly
- The build process is compatible with environments that don't have C++ build tools
- Performance remains good for most use cases with the classic architecture

## Future Considerations

If you need to re-enable the new architecture in the future:
1. Set `newArchEnabled=true` in gradle.properties
2. Remove or set to `true` the fabric and turbomodules properties
3. Ensure CMake and NDK are properly configured
4. Update native modules to support TurboModules if needed
