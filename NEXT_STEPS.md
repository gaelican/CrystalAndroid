# Next Steps to Build Your APK

Your CrystalAndroid project is now ready for cloud build! Here are your options:

## 🚀 Quickest Option: GitHub Actions (Recommended)

1. **Create a GitHub repository:**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name it "CrystalAndroid"
   - Make it public (for free builds)
   - Don't initialize with README

2. **Push your code:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CrystalAndroid.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Get your APK:**
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
   - You'll see the build running automatically
   - Once complete (about 10-15 minutes), click on the run
   - Download "app-debug" artifact
   - This is your APK file!

## 📱 Alternative: Expo EAS (Works from your phone)

1. **Install EAS CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g eas-cli
   ```

2. **Login to Expo:**
   ```bash
   eas login
   ```
   (Create account at https://expo.dev if needed)

3. **Build APK:**
   ```bash
   eas build --platform android --profile preview --local-builds-only=false
   ```

4. **Download:**
   - You'll get a link to download the APK
   - No Git required!

## 🎯 What You Get

The APK will include:
- ✅ Full React Native app
- ✅ JGit integration for git operations
- ✅ Home screen with navigation
- ✅ Git testing interface
- ✅ All dependencies bundled

## 📱 Installing on Your Device

1. Download the APK
2. Open your file manager
3. Navigate to Downloads
4. Tap on the APK file
5. Allow installation from unknown sources if prompted
6. Install and open!

## 🧪 Testing the App

Once installed:
1. Open Crystal Android
2. Tap "Git Test" button
3. Try initializing a repository
4. Test git operations

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

- Terminal emulation not implemented yet
- No Claude integration yet
- Basic UI only
- Git operations work but need internet for clone/push/pull

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If the build fails:
- Make sure you pushed all files
- Check the Actions tab for error logs
- Common issue: JGit version conflicts (already fixed in our setup)
