# Crystal Android Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the work done to port the Crystal desktop application to Android using React Native.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Project Analysis
- Analyzed the Crystal desktop application (Electron-based)
- Identified core features: git worktree management, Claude Code integration, terminal access
- Determined React Native as the best porting strategy

### 2. Android Git Integration
- Implemented JGit-based native module for git operations
- Created GitModule.java with full git functionality:
  - Repository initialization and cloning
  - Commit, push, pull operations
  - Branch management
  - Worktree creation (key Crystal feature)
  - Diff generation
- Added authentication support via username/password

### 3. Project Structure
- Set up React Native 0.80.1 project
- Created organized directory structure:
  ```
  src/
  ├── components/    # UI components
  ├── screens/       # App screens
  ├── services/      # Business logic
  ├── stores/        # State management
  ├── types/         # TypeScript types
  └── utils/         # Utilities
  ```

### 4. Native Module Integration
- Created CrystalAndroidPackage to register native modules
- Updated MainApplication.kt to include the package
- Set up GitService.ts as JavaScript interface to native module

### 5. UI Implementation
- Created HomeScreen with project and session management
- Added GitTestScreen for testing git operations
- Implemented navigation with React Navigation
- Applied basic styling and theming

### 6. Dependencies
- Added necessary React Native libraries:
  - Navigation: @react-navigation/native
  - UI: react-native-elements
  - State: zustand
  - Storage: react-native-sqlite-storage
  - File System: react-native-fs

## Key Architecture Decisions

### 1. JGit vs Command Line Git
- Chose JGit for better Android compatibility
- Avoids dependency on external git binary
- Provides full programmatic control

### 2. Storage Strategy
- Use app's internal storage for repositories
- Avoids Android Scoped Storage restrictions
- Ensures data persistence and security

### 3. Authentication
- Support username/password for simplicity
- TODO: Add SSH key support for better security

## Current State
The application has:
- ✅ Basic React Native structure
- ✅ JGit integration for git operations
- ✅ Navigation and basic UI
- ✅ TypeScript types from desktop version
- ✅ State management setup

## Next Steps

### High Priority
1. **Build and Test**: Run on actual Android device/emulator
2. **Terminal Emulator**: Implement terminal functionality
3. **Claude Integration**: Port Claude Code SDK integration
4. **UI Components**: Port remaining Crystal UI components

### Medium Priority
1. **Database**: Implement SQLite for project/session storage
2. **File Management**: Add file browser and editor
3. **Settings**: Add configuration screens
4. **Sync**: Implement data synchronization

### Future Enhancements
1. **SSH Support**: Add SSH key authentication
2. **Performance**: Optimize for large repositories
3. **Offline Mode**: Better offline capabilities
4. **Tablets**: Optimize UI for tablets

## Technical Considerations

### Android Limitations
- No direct terminal access (need PTY emulation)
- File system restrictions (use internal storage)
- Background process limitations
- Memory constraints for large repos

### Security
- Credentials stored securely in Android Keystore
- Repositories isolated in app sandbox
- No external storage permissions required

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for git operations
2. Integration tests for native modules
3. UI tests with React Native Testing Library
4. Manual testing on various Android versions

## Build Instructions
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for Android
cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug

# Run on device/emulator
npm run android
```

## Known Issues
- Terminal emulation not yet implemented
- Large repository performance not tested
- No error recovery for network failures
